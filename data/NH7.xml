      <p>You sit in my chair, I make sure that I introduce myself to your hair. I feel it. I massage the scalp. I just get familiar. With <persName ref="#IRAE">Issa</persName> — she just lets me create. </p>
      <p>I do not realize how much <persName ref="#IRAE">Issa Rae’s</persName> hair <seg type="natural-hair">has impacted the natural hair community.</seg> </p>
      <p>With <persName ref="#IRAE">Issa Rae</persName> on <name type="TV-show">Insecure</name>, we did like — 100 hair styles last season. I’m reading the script and I’m like, OK, this hairstyle should last for 2 days. But we got so into it because the way you shoot is out of sequence. And people — they would go on <orgName ref="#TWTR">Twitter</orgName> and say, “OK, so she had one hairstyle for breakfast and another one for lunch.” But they loved it. <seg type="natural-hair">What ever you see on straight hair, I feel I can create it with natural hair.</seg> I started doing hair when I was itty-bitty young because no one could do my hair. When I went to the salon as a kid, it was like, “Oh she’s got long hair and it’s straight and beautiful. How can I get that?” And I didn’t get that. That was not my hair. <persName ref="#SKW"> Susan Kelechi Watson</persName> from <name type="tv-show">This Is Us</name> is one of my clients; <persName ref="#YAS">Yara Shahidi</persName>, <persName ref="#ADV">Ava DuVernay</persName>, <persName ref="#LEW">Lena Waithe</persName>. I draw my inspiration from the old and the new. I may go all the way back to a style out of <placeName>Africa</placeName> from the 1800s. Old braid styles that have been forgotten. I also will go to old <placeName>Hollywood</placeName>. All the <orgName>YouTubers</orgName> and the bloggers, all the young girls creating in their bathroom, videotaping—I watch them. Every time I create or design a hairstyle that I know will be on the carpet or go viral, it is always about the community of natural hair. <seg type="natural-hair">We are innovators. We will always be.</seg> </p>
