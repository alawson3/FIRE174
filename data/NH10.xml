        <p><persName>@Iron_Spike</persName>Black Hair for Non-Black Artists: a Cheat Sheet Thread.</p>
        <p>Hi, folks! Just spur-of-the-moment decided to put together some reference for folks who want to draw/model black characters in their work, but aren't confident they won't make simple, obvious mistakes <choice><orig>w/r/t</orig><expan>with regard to</expan></choice> black hair.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="reply">
        <p>Black people can have any hair texture, but what's commonly considered "black hair" is hair that's tightly coiled, with each individual hair shaft looking like a Slinky. These Slinky-hairs interlocking with lots of space between them is what gives black hair so much volume.</p>
      </div>
      <div type="reply">
        <p>The most common convention for classifying hair types (in my experience) is the letter/number one. "black hair" generally rangers from <supplied source="https://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types/curly">3A</supplied> ("good hair") to <supplied source="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/home/3-reasons-why-4c-hair-is-different-than-other-texture-types">4c</supplied> ("bad hair'). Traditionally, the kinkier/coilier hair was, the "worse" it was. Some older people still hold this standard.</p>

        <p>The <supplied source="https://www.allure.com/gallery/a-timeline-of-the-best-afros">Afros</supplied> we associate with the 60s, <name>Black Panthers</name>, and black liberation movements are direct rebellions to then widely-held beliefs that natural black hair was unkempt, dirty, unprofessional, shameful, and ugly. They are the haircut equivalents of "fuck you."</p>

      <div type="reply">
        <p>Just a few years earlier, the only acceptable hair was a slicked-to-the-skull pomade look or "conk" (chemically straightened with lye) look for men. Women also straightened their hair with heat/chemicals, or wore wigs.</p>
        <p>My very proper grandmother REFUSED to go wigless, for ex.</p>

      <div type="reply">
        <p>This mandatory altering black hair to mimic straight hair goes back much farther, though. These standards were extant in the Victorian age, for the people with the means to maintain it.</p>

        <p>The rise of black pride/identity has slowly but surely made "natural hair" (still called that if the curl pattern is not permanently altered, even if it's in yarn braids and colored green) more acceptable and popular. However, ignorance about the nature of black hair abounds</p>
      </div>
      <div type="reply">
        <p>For years, the <orgName>Army</orgName> banned certain hairstyles that were paradoxically among the easiest for a busy woman with kinky hair to maintain, like <supplied source="https://www.naturallycurly.com/curlreading/hair-growth/my-9-month-loc-journey-update">dreadlocks</supplied>, <supplied source="https://naturallclub.com/blogs/the-naturall-club-blog/10-simple-hairstyles-for-short-natural-hair-or-twa">TWAs</supplied> (teeny weeny afros), and <supplied source="https://www.essence.com/hair/braids/celebs-cornrows/">cornrows</supplied> (the bans have since been lifted, after outcry.)</p>

        <p>And pictured below are students recently threatened with punishment by their schools for "violating dress codes." Three of them are literally just wearing their hair as it grows from their heads; the other two have simple box braids.</p>
